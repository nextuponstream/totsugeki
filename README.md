# Totsugeki

Tools to create, manage and visualize brackets for double-elimination
tournaments.

Check out the [demo](https://totsugeki.fly.dev/).

In this repo, you will find the `totsugeki` library, which allows to create and
update double-elimination brackets. 

To use a working management bracket tool, you need to build 
`tournament-organiser-api` and host statically the build folder of 
`tournament-organiser-web`.

You can use a hosting service like flyio. Check out `docs/flyio.md`
